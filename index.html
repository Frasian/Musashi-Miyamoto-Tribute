  <h2>Biography</h2>
<div class="container">
<div class="text-left">
  
<p>Although not as politically inclined, or a famed general or warlord as many of the others on this list, there is perhaps no greater swordsman in the history of Japan than the legendary Miyamoto Musashi (at least to Westerners). Although he was technically a roaming ronin (a samurai without a master), Musashi became renowned through stories of his excellent swordsmanship in numerous duels.</p>

<p>Musashi was the founder of the Niten-ryū style of swordsmanship, known for its use of two-sword techniques – using a katana and wakizashi at the same time. He was also the author of The Book of Five Rings, a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today.</p>

<p>According to his own claims, Musashi fought his first duel at the age of 13, where he beat a man named Arika Kihei to death with a quarterstaff. He grew up dueling adepts from famous sword-schools, but never lost.</p>

<p>In one duel against the famed Yoshioka school, Musashi reportedly broke a habit of showing up late, arrived hours early, killed the 12-year-old headmaster, and then escaped while being attacked by dozens of his victim’s supporters. To escape, he drew his second sword, and this dual-wielding style was the beginning of his niten’ichi (“two heavens as one”) sword style.</p>

<p>Musashi is said to have roamed the land and fought in over 60 duels, and was never defeated. This is a conservative estimate, most likely not taking into account the deaths by his hand in major battles he participated in. In his later years, he dueled less and wrote more, retiring to a cave to write the Book of the Five Rings. He died in the cave in 1645, having foreseen his death, and died in a posture where he sat with one knee vertically raised and held his wakizashi in his left hand, and a cane in his right.</p>
